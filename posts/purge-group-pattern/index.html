Since a CDN usually
heavily caches requests, the origin only receives a fraction of all customers' traffic.</p><p>For a short amount of time following a purge operation, the CDN&rsquo;s cache is empty and all
incoming requests are forwarded to the origin. If the cache/hit
ratio of the CDN is 98%, the number of requests hitting the origin immediately after the
purge might be up to 50 times greater than usual. This is a problem known as
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem>thundering herd</a>.
As the cache is being repopulated, the cache/hit ratio will gradually increase and the number
of requests hitting the origin will slowly go back to normal.</p><p>Often, the origin is not sized to deal with such sudden increase in load. Therefore,
fully purging the cache is prohibitively expensive, and a tool of last resort.</p><p>A solution to solve this problem would be to purge the cache gradually over time, rather than
in one fast operation. Unfortunately, no CDN vendor provides this as a feature.</p><p><em>Enter Surrogate-Keys / Cache-Tags.</em></p><p>Most CDN providers allow you to purge a cache by <em>Key</em>: <a href=https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/getting-started-with-surrogate-keys>Fastly</a>,
<a href=https://developer.akamai.com/blog/2019/03/28/technical-deep-dive-purging-cache-tag>Akamai</a>,
<a href=https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169246-Purging-cached-resources-from-Cloudflare#h_6d756ac9-c476-45e8-a5d4-e2a6e45d9dc7>Cloudflare</a>,
and many more support this.</p><p>By assigning a random &ldquo;PurgeGroupID&rdquo; cache-tag to all requests, for example
between PurgeGroup0 and PurgeGroup99, we can divide the cache in similarly-sized
buckets - each containing around 1% of requests. Purging one of these PurgeGroups
will therefore purge about 1% of the cache.</p><p>Adding such a cache-tag can be done either at the origin, or directly in the CDN, depending
on the provider: the following example with Fastly adds a random PurgeGroup surrogate-key to each request:</p><p><a href=https://fiddle.fastlydemo.net/fiddle/d4b88fa4/embedded>Go look at this fiddle</a></p><p>The cache can then be purged gradually:</p><pre><code class=language-bash>#!/bin/bash
FASTLY_TOKEN=secrettoken
SERVICE_ID=123456
for PURGE_GROUP in `seq 0 99`; do
  curl -X POST -H "Fastly-Key:${FASTLY_TOKEN}" https://api.fastly.com/service/${SERVICE_ID}/purge/product/${PURGE_GROUP}
done

depend on how fast the purge needs to happen, and on how many requests the origin is able
to receive.</p><p>I refer to this method as the &ldquo;PurgeGroup pattern&rdquo;. It is pretty simple, and should work
with most major CDN providers.</p></div></div><script defer src=https://fiddle.fastlydemo.net/embed.js></script><script defer src=/js/prism.js></script></body></html>
