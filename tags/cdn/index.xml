Did you, like me, assume that the time of day should have nothing to do with internet speed?
Today, we will look into the following graph, showing increased average and median latency during night-time for a large website as experienced by users in South America. By understanding Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), TCP, and stateful HTTP connections better, we will demonstrate why a large portion of websites is indeed slightly slower at night.</description></item><item><title>The curious case of the CDN Cache-HISS</title><link>https://yann.mandragor.org/posts/cache-hiss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yann.mandragor.org/posts/cache-hiss/</guid><description>A few years ago, I was asked to take a more active role maintaining the CDN configuration of the company I work for. My knowledge of CDNs at the time was pretty basic and could be summarised by the following diagram:
&amp;ldquo;Sure, I got this&amp;rdquo;. And for a short time, things were good. But soon after, I was asked the following question:
&amp;ldquo;We are reviewing the performance of a client&amp;rsquo;s requests - several of their requests are quite slow, despite being Cache HITs.</description></item><item><title>Solving the CDN post-purge thundering herd problem: The PurgeGroup pattern</title><link>https://yann.mandragor.org/posts/purge-group-pattern/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yann.mandragor.org/posts/purge-group-pattern/</guid><description>Purging a Content Delivery Network (CDN) cache can be a risky endeavour. Since a CDN usually heavily caches requests, the origin only receives a fraction of all customers' traffic.
For a short amount of time following a purge operation, the CDN cache is empty and all incoming requests are sent to the origin. If the cache hit ratio is usually around 98%, the number of requests hitting the origin immediately after the purge might be up to 50 times greater than usual.</description></item></channel></rss>
