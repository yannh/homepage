Like me, did you assume that the time of day should have nothing to do with Internet speed&amp;hellip; ?
Today I would like to explain the following graph, showing the average and median latency for a large website, as seen by users in South America. By understanding Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), TCP, and stateful HTTP connections better, we will demonstrate why a large portion of websites is indeed slightly slower at night.</description></item><item><title>The curious case of the CDN Cache-HISS</title><link>https://yann.mandragor.org/posts/cache-hiss/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yann.mandragor.org/posts/cache-hiss/</guid><description>A few years ago, I was asked to take a more active role maintaining the CDN configuration of the company I work for. My knowledge of CDNs at the time was pretty basic and could be summarised by the following diagram:
&amp;ldquo;Sure, I got this&amp;rdquo;. And for a short time, things were good. But soon after, I was asked the following question:
&amp;ldquo;We are reviewing the performance of a client&amp;rsquo;s requests - several of their requests are quite slow, despite being Cache HITs.</description></item><item><title>Solving the CDN post-purge thundering herd problem: The PurgeGroup pattern</title><link>https://yann.mandragor.org/posts/purge-group-pattern/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://yann.mandragor.org/posts/purge-group-pattern/</guid><description>Purging a Content Delivery Network (CDN) cache can be a risky endeavour. Since a CDN usually heavily caches requests, the origin only receives a fraction of all customers' traffic.
For a short amount of time following a purge operation, the CDN cache is empty and all incoming requests are sent to the origin. If the cache hit ratio is usually around 98%, the number of requests hitting the origin immediately after the purge might be up to 50 times greater than usual.</description></item></channel></rss>
